# Opioid Addiction Crisis in Virginia

Virginia  is  currently  under  a  public  health  emergency  asa  result  of  the  opioid  addiction  crisis.  Our  state  has  beenseverely impacted by opioid abuse, and the situation has beenescalating  surprisingly  fast  in  recent  years.  In  1999,  the  firstyear for which such data is available, approximately 23 peopledied  from  abuse  of  prescription  opioids.  However,  by  2017,the  most  recent  year  for  which  complete  data  is  available,1445  people  died  of  the  overdose  of  Fentanyl,  Heroin,  orPrescription Opioid, an epidemic increase of roughly 6200%.[5]  Moreover,  the  data  of  2015-2017  alone,  showed  us  thatthere  was  a  staggering  increase  of  more  than  60%  in  deathattributed  to  drug  overdose.  Drug-related  deaths  have  risenunrelentingly,  and  the  drugs  kill  more  people  annually  inVirginia than either car crashes or gunfire. This situation needsto  be  controlled,  and  we  should  contribute  our  efforts  ascommunity members.Our project is intended to study the drug abuse problem here inVirginia using machine learning methods, and bring awarenessto this widespread public health issue by presenting a thoroughanalysis  of  the  problem,  and  possible  solutions  for  differentparties to reverse the epidemic of opioid drug overdose deathsand protect the public from overdose and other harms.
